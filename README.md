# Time Blocks interview-like problem
 Trying to come up with my solution to the problem seen in this video: https://youtu.be/3Q_oYDQ2whs<br>
 Also, trying RubyÂ ðŸ’Ž  for the first time

## Algorithm ðŸ‘¾
- Look at both sets of busy time
- Save every available time for both people
  with the interview time
- Compare both available times and eliminate the ones that are 
  before the latest starting schedule and after the earliest
  ending schedule
